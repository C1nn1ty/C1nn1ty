- 👋 Hi, I’m Jaxyn
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of different things: Web development and other tools like react.js, but I have also always been interested in forms of art like liturature, music, graphic design, as well as things like drawing, painting, ect. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything. I like to hear other peoples ideas and see their skills in action. I like collaborationg as long as everyone is enjoying the topic at hand. As for collbrative work, I have always believed in the idea "The more brains the better" when it comes to any form of work. I find that when you work on your own things somtimes dont go as smoothly as one may hope. I always like to ask questions about my work so I have other peoples opinions not just my own.
- 📫 You can reach me at my business email-> cinnity@yahoo.com :D
